#' compute number of samples needed to establish maximum defect rate with enough certainty
#'
#' In sampling we have a file of like items.
#' We want to estimate the overall defect rate of  the items.
#' This function guesses the number of draws needed
#' to establish with some certainty that the defect rate is below a certain threshold.
#'
#' Each of the three arguments can have length > 1, but only one of these
#' three arguments.
#'
#' @param posited_defect_rate The defect rate of which we want to see how many
#'     samples it would take to establish that it is below the allowed defect rate.
#'     Could for example be our guess of the defect rate.
#' @param allowed_defect_rate The highest defect rate that is still acceptable.
#'     So the threshold.
#'     Should be higher than posited_defect_rate.
#' @param cert The certainty level you want, e.g. \code{0.95}.
#'
#' @returns An estimate of the needed number of samples. If the number of
#'     needed samples comes to close to the maximum integer value, return -1.
